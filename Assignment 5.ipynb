    "The Four pillars of Object oriented Programming system are as follows\n",
    "1. Inheritance\n",
    "2. Abstraction\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "4. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A] Inheritance: \n",
    "    It is the pillar in which the property of parent class is acquired or inheritted by the child class. It is of two types \n",
    "    that is multiple inheritance and multi level inheritance. In multiple inheritance the properties of more than one parent \n",
    "    class is acquired by the child class. Whereas in the multi level inheritance the properties of the parent classes in higher\n",
    "    hierarchy are acquired by the child class.\n",
    "B] Abstraction:\n",
    "    It is the property through which the user is not exposed to the complexity of the code or the class in particular.\n",
    "    It hides the actual inbuilt coded part.\n",
    "    For example to add two numbers we can simply write 1 + 2 and we can get answer as 3.\n",
    "    But the system processes the \"+\" as 1.__add__(2) to give answer as 3\n",
    "C] Polymorphism:\n",
    "    It is a property in which the class or function behaves diffferently and gives different output when the type of input \n",
    "    changes.\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "        def add(a,b):\n",
    "            return a+b\n",
    "    In the above example if we pass integer parameters to the function we will get the sum of the integers.\n",
    "    But if we pass two strings as a parameter to the function, we get the output as cocatenated string.\n",
    "D] Encapsulation:\n",
    "    It is a wrapper that hides and protects the code so that it cannot be interfered or tampered. \n",
    "    In this method the user may not be aware of the actual process and variables used but can access it through different\n",
    "    function created for the same purpose.\n",
    "    For example: Bank account details: The user need not know and should not be able to modify the account credentials \n",
    "    and other parameters such as bank balance or file number or customer id. Hence they are encapsulated, although the account\n",
    "    holders are still given access to the account balance just for seeing and not for modification."
